Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The DriverPass project is about a company called DriverPass who wants to create a system that helps new drivers pass their DMV licensing tests. The type of system they wanted designed was a web-hosted system supported by the cloud.

What did you do particularly well?

My business requirement document was the part of the course I did the best in personally. I felt like I understood what each aspect of that project was asking me to do and I think my responses were good.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

The one part I would like to revise would be the system design document's case diagram. I would want to redo the use cases I chose and how they link up with the actors to better match the UML class diagram I made. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

What I did to interpret the user's needs and implement them was to first take the information provided and create the backbone of my design using only that information. Then I would infer other needs of the requirements to try and wrap all the requirements into groups that go together. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because they are the ones using it, so making it accessible to them is the number one priority.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

My approach to designing software is to first take the requirements given and write the backbone of my design using that information, then I would bring them together into groups that compliment each other. The techniques I would use in the future would be to use a case diagram to get a better overall look into the organization of the requirements to better design a system.
